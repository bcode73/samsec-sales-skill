## Do I Need These Tools?

**No, they're optional.** The sales skills work without them—Claude will use its built-in knowledge and any information you provide.

**With tools enabled**, Claude can:
- Search the web in real-time for company news
- Find and verify email addresses
- Look up LinkedIn profiles
- Get current information instead of relying on training data

**Start without tools**, then add them later if you want enhanced research capabilities.

---

## Quick Start: The Easiest Option

If you just want one tool to start, **get Perplexity**. It's the most versatile:
- Real-time web search
- Works for company research, prospect research, and signal verification
- Simple API with clear pricing

## Testing Your Setup

After setup, test each tool in Claude Code:

**Test Perplexity:**
> "Use Perplexity to search for recent news about Salesforce"

**Test Exa:**
> "Use Exa to find the LinkedIn profile for Marc Benioff"

**Test Hunter:**
> "Use Hunter to find email addresses at Salesforce.com"

**Test Apify:**
> "Use Apify to find open sales jobs at Salesforce"

If it works, you'll see results. If not, check the troubleshooting section below.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Tool not found" or "MCP server error"

1. Make sure you set the environment variable correctly
2. Make sure you changed `"disabled": true` to `"disabled": false`
3. Restart Claude Code completely (quit and reopen)

### "Invalid API key" or "Authentication failed"

1. Double-check you copied the full API key
2. Make sure there are no extra spaces before or after the key
3. Verify the key works by logging into the service's website

### "Rate limit exceeded"

You've used up your free tier or hit a usage limit. Either:
- Wait until your limit resets (usually monthly)
- Upgrade to a paid plan
- Use a different tool for now

### Windows: Environment variable not working

1. Make sure you restarted your computer after adding the variable
2. Open a new Command Prompt and type: `echo %PERPLEXITY_API_KEY%`
3. If it shows your key, it's working. Restart Claude Code.
4. If it's blank, redo the environment variable steps.

### Mac: Environment variable not working

1. Open Terminal and type: `echo $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
2. If it shows your key, it's working. Restart Claude Code.
3. If it's blank, make sure you ran `source ~/.zshrc`
4. If still blank, check you saved the file correctly

## Claude Desktop Setup

**Using Claude Desktop instead of Claude Code?** The MCP research tools work there too! Here's how to set them up.

### Do Skills Work in Claude Desktop?

| Feature | Claude Code | Claude Desktop |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Skills auto-load | Yes | No |
| MCP Tools | Yes | Yes |

**Skills** (like the POWERFUL framework) won't automatically load in Claude Desktop, but you can:
- Add SKILL.md files to a **Project** as knowledge files
- Copy/paste skill content into your conversation
- Reference the frameworks manually

**MCP Tools** (Perplexity, Exa, Hunter, Apify) work in both, but need different configuration.

### Setting Up MCP Tools in Claude Desktop

#### Step 1: Set Your API Keys

Follow the same instructions above for [Mac](#for-mac-users) or [Windows](#for-windows-users) to set your environment variables. This step is the same.

#### Step 2: Find Your Claude Desktop Config File

**Mac:**
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

To open it:
1. Open **Finder**
2. Press `Cmd + Shift + G`
3. Paste: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`
4. Open `claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor

**Windows:**
```
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

To open it:
1. Press `Windows + R`
2. Type: `%APPDATA%\Claude`
3. Press Enter
4. Open `claude_desktop_config.json` in Notepad

#### Step 3: Add MCP Server Configuration

If the file is empty or doesn't exist, create it with this content. If it exists, add the `mcpServers` section.

**Add only the tools you have API keys for:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "perplexity": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/mcp-server-perplexity"],
      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "pplx-your-key-here"
      }
    },
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "exa-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "EXA_API_KEY": "your-exa-key-here"
      }
    },
    "hunter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/mcp-server-fetch"],
      "env": {
        "HUNTER_API_KEY": "your-hunter-key-here"
      }
    },
    "apify": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/mcp-server-apify"],
      "env": {
        "APIFY_API_TOKEN": "your-apify-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important:** Replace `your-key-here` with your actual API keys, OR use environment variable references like `${PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}` if you set them in Step 1.

#### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop

Completely quit Claude Desktop and reopen it. The tools should now be available.

#### Step 5: Test It

In a new Claude Desktop conversation, try:
> "Use Perplexity to search for recent news about Salesforce"

If it works, you'll see search results. If not, check troubleshooting below.

### Claude Desktop Troubleshooting

**"Tool not found" error:**
- Make sure `claude_desktop_config.json` is valid JSON (no trailing commas, proper quotes)
- Restart Claude Desktop completely (quit, not just close window)
- Check that Node.js is installed: open Terminal/Command Prompt and type `node --version`

**"Invalid API key" error:**
- Double-check your API key is correct in the config file
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes

**Config file doesn't exist:**
- Create it yourself at the path shown above
- Make sure it's named exactly `claude_desktop_config.json`

**Node.js not installed:**
Claude Desktop MCP tools require Node.js. Install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (choose the LTS version).

### Using Skills in Claude Desktop Projects

While skills don't auto-load, you can add them to Projects:

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Click **Projects** in the sidebar
3. Create a new project (e.g., "Sales Tools")
4. Click **Add Content** → **Add Files**
5. Navigate to the `sales-skills/skills/` folder
6. Add the SKILL.md files you want (e.g., `powerful-framework/SKILL.md`)
7. Start a conversation in that project—Claude will reference the skills

**Recommended skills to add:**
- `powerful-framework/SKILL.md` - Deal qualification
- `prospect-research/SKILL.md` - Research framework
- `company-intelligence/SKILL.md` - Company research
- `cold-call-scripts/SKILL.md` - Call preparation
